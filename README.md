<img src="https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/51518iris%20img1.png">

## Objective

Classify Iris flowers using machine learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Algorithms Used

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Logistic Regression

## Additional Tools/Methods

- Metrics (for evaluating model performance)
- Train-Test Split (for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets)

## Dataset

[Iris Dataset](link_to_dataset)

## Project Description

The project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to classify Iris flowers:

- Algorithms are utilized for both supervised (Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression) and unsupervised learning.
- Metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of the models.
- Train-Test Split is employed to divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (include any specific instructions).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or script files.
